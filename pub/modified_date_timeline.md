## Download Rates

This is intended to serve as a reference for file dates in the Facepunch/VCC leak era files, and to contain interesting observations into their "download rate". 

Many released files contain differing times on their Last Modified dates, between when the computer starts downloading (, moving, etc; when the computer finishes writing, it always uses the current time) the files and when it finishes. By observing the ratio of the amount of time it took to complete to the size of the files, we can determine a "download rate". If we put files of the same day together and assume they are excerpts of a collection, we can estimate the size of the files in between these released files. IF the collection was continuously downloaded, then the time between between our excerpts indicates the size of the files between them. Unique circumstances, such as specific inferences (da repo!) and the oddly internally-consistent dates between separate releases contribute to this being a sensible approach. 

Further, observe differences in the mentioned download rate. The slower they are indicates possible tampering with the sourcees - files were removed and the dates on the files were still preserved - thus less files per second. This can be used to indicate sources, and implies differences in how these files were originally obtained. 

Only to-the-second precision was used for the math. Smaller files are more likely to be inaccurate representations of the download rate, while larger ones will be less affected. 

Times are indicated in YYYY-MM-DD, HH-MM-SS. (( indicates the earliest file in the release, while )) the last. (( )) means the file has uniform timestamps.

## Oddities


### Bullsquid

While all of the model files are dated 8/16, the art is dated 8/22.  

### Cremator

There is a gap of two and a half minutes between the cremator's model sources and the Source Art of the cremator gun. This alongside the low download rate and various gaps implies this source was heavily trimmed. 

### Elite Metrocop Compiled

Timestamps are inconsistent.

### Facemap Sources

![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020221025184348.png)

The files released are split by gender. This is congruous with the newly released /Humans/ source files, which duplicate them.

If we take out the gap, the new rate is 25.5 MB/s. The gap between these two sections is implied to be ~408 MB. 

### Half-Life 2 Mapsources

There are two sets of timestamps: 20 seconds and 40 seconds. 

In 40 seconds is:
* All background maps
* d1_canals_01
* d1_canals_02
* d1_canals_03
* All of d2_prison
* d3_c17_01 to d3_c17_08

In 20 seconds is the rest. 

Do you spot a pattern? 

### Ministrider

Major gap between Ministrider's source art and the normal files. Without it, the download rate increases to 0.31 MB

### Police_XSI

There are gaps in timestamp usage in the files.

The textures in Source Art are in two separate chunks with a gap of a minute. The selection indicates the separation.

In the base directory, the timestamps' order doesn't fully correspond alphabetically. Exceptions to it are pictured:
